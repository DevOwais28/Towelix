Create a complete UI-only React application named “Towelix”.
Use React + Vite + Tailwind CSS and take visual inspiration from this site:
https://unitedtowel.com/

This project is UI only, meaning:

No backend

No API requests

Use dummy JSON data for users, orders, and products

Role selection should be simulated using local state or context

🎭 Roles (UI Simulation Only)

There are 2 roles:

Owner / Manufacturer (Admin)

Customer

Create a temporary login page that allows selecting:

“Login as Owner”

“Login as Customer”

Based on role, render UI accordingly.

Store role in React Context.
